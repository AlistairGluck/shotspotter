# shotspotter

This repo contains the code to create a shinyapp with 2 tabs, one is interactive and allows the user to input a range of rounds fired in Fresno, CA, and the map will update to include only datapoints from those instances.  The other is an animation over time of the aggregate shots. (https://alistairgluck.shinyapps.io/Shotspotter/).
